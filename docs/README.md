> technical documentation for MATE 2019

This directory is the central development workspace for the Rogue Robotics technical documentation for the 2019 MATE ROV competition. The primary contents are:

* `rogue2019.tex`: the main LaTeX source
* `rogue2019-cover.pdf`: the pretty cover page
* `rogue2019.pdf`: the compiled documentation
* `img/`: the image resources we need
* `build.sh`: the build script
* `roguedoc.cls`: the LaTeX class file
* `misc/`: miscellaneous documentation that is **not** directly involved with the final competition documentation

I'm still in the process of migrating the old 2018 resources here, so it's still incomplete.
