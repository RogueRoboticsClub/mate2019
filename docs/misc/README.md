> miscellaneous system documentation

This directory contains documentation for parts of the system that are useful for the developers but aren't directly related to the final documentation that we're submitting to the judges. Each sub-directory contains documentation for a specific part of the system; e.g. the `dynamics/` directory documents the dynamic control of the ROV.

These documents are provided in the hope that they will clarify certain system design decisions.
