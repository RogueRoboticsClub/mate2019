> master repository for the MATE 2019 competition

Rogue Robotics is a rogue robotics team that competes in the MATE underwater robotics competition. This repository is the master container for all development work that goes on for the ROV. It is split into:

* `topside/`: the surface-side code running on a laptop
* `bottomside/`: the code running on the ROV itself
* `docs/`: the technical documentation of the system

See each sub-directory for more details.

## Getting Started
The topside code is written in Python. You may need to install a few packages for it to work. If you're on Linux, the great and illustrious Uwe has compiled the topside code into an executable you can use.

The bottomside code should be compiled and loaded onto the Arduino. As you can tell, I'm writing this because I'm bored and don't have any mechanics work to do.
